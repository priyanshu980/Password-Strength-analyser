    <h1>Password Strength Checker</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Password Strength Checker project!</p>
    <p>This project is designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords based on various criteria, including length, character variety, and patterns.</p>
    <p>To use the password strength checker, simply enter your desired password and click the "Check Strength" button. The checker will then analyze your password and provide a strength rating.</p>
    <p>The strength of the password is classified into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Passwords that do not meet the minimum criteria for strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Passwords that meet some criteria but may still be vulnerable.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Passwords that meet most or all of the criteria and are considered secure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to contribute to this project by providing feedback, suggesting improvements, or contributing code enhancements.</p>
